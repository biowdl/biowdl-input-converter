BioWDL input converter
========================

This tool was created to let biowdl handle a variety of inputs and
convert these to WDL Structs that can be used in the pipeline.

Thanks to this tool, the pipeline's input structure can be changed
without changes to the user input. This allows greater flexibility
for the BioWDL developers.

This also allows BioWDL to support multiple input formats to make
it easier for the users.
